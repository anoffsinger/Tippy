# Pre-work - Tippy

Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Adam Noffsinger

Time spent: ~2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Custom font
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x]  Moved some items around to make the layout a little more clear and (not sure if this is considered a "UI animation") added a color change to the background view while toggling through tip percentages

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

No large challenges! Adding the color changes took the most time, because I had to get a better grasp on how UIColor works and how if statements are structured in Swift - very similar to Javascript luckily.
